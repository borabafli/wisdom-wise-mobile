Onboarding Page Content
Step 1: The Welcome
(Full-screen image of Anu, looking warm and welcoming)

Text on screen: Hey, I'm Anu...

(Animated text appears below): ...your personal guide on the path to self-discovery.

Why it works: It's simple, clean, and immediately establishes the app's persona (Anu) and its core purpose (self-discovery) in a gentle, welcoming way.

Step 2: The Core Benefits
Headline: Here's how we'll journey together.

(Use icons for each of the three benefits below)

Benefit 1: Chat with a Guide Who Remembers

Subtext: Our conversations build on each other. I'll remember your insights and progress to provide truly personal support.

Benefit 2: Uncover Your Thinking Patterns

Subtext: We'll go beyond simple mood tracking to gently identify and reframe unhelpful thoughts on your personal Insights Dashboard.

Benefit 3: Build Real Skills with Proven Tools

Subtext: Practice and grow with a library of guided exercises rooted in proven methods like CBT and Mindfulness.

Why it works: The headline frames the relationship as a "journey." The subtext for each benefit clearly explains the value of that feature, pulling directly from your PRD's strengths (AI Memory, Insights Dashboard, CBT exercises).

Step 3: Personal Values
Headline: Let's find your compass.

Body Copy: To start, let's connect with what truly matters to you. Understanding your core values helps me guide you on a path that feels authentic and meaningful.

Prompt: What is most important to you? (Select up to 3)

Why it works: The headline "Let's find your compass" is more evocative and less generic than "Let's personalize your experience." It fits the "journey" metaphor perfectly. The body copy you wrote is excellentâ€”it clearly explains why you're asking for this information.

Step 4: Personal Challenges
Headline: Where should we begin our journey?

Body Copy: Everyone's path is unique. Letting me know where you'd like to focus helps me suggest the most helpful first steps and exercises for you.

Prompt: What would you like to focus on?

Why it works: This is perfect as is. The copy is empathetic, clear, and logically follows the previous step. No changes needed.
