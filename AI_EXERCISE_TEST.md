# 🧪 AI Exercise Suggestion Test

## ✅ **Progress So Far**
- ✅ Exercise card component works (test button shows card)
- ✅ State management works  
- ❌ AI isn't suggesting exercises

## 🔧 **New Test Setup**

I've added:
1. **Enhanced AI prompts** - More explicit about suggesting exercises
2. **Blue "🧪 AI Stress Test" button** - Sends a stress message designed to trigger exercise suggestion
3. **Better debug logging**

## 🧪 **Test Steps**

### **Step 1: Test AI Response**
1. **Start app**: `npx expo start`
2. **Click blue "🧪 AI Stress Test" button**
3. **Watch console logs**

**This button sends:** 
> "I'm feeling really anxious and overwhelmed. I have negative thoughts racing through my mind and I need help."

**Expected AI response should include:**
```json
{
  "message": "I understand you're going through a difficult time...",
  "suggestions": ["Yes, please help", "What can I do?", "I need guidance"],
  "nextAction": "showExerciseCard",
  "exerciseData": {"type": "breathing" or "automatic-thoughts", "name": "..."}
}
```

### **Step 2: Check Console Output**

**Look for these logs:**
```
🔍 Exercise card debug - nextAction: showExerciseCard
🔍 Exercise card debug - exerciseData: {type: "...", name: "..."}
🎯 Exercise card should show! Type: ...
```

**If you see:**
```
🔍 Exercise card debug - nextAction: undefined
🔍 Exercise card debug - exerciseData: undefined
```
**Then:** AI model isn't following the structured output format

### **Step 3: Manual Test** 
Try typing directly:
- "I need help with anxiety"
- "Can you suggest a breathing exercise?"
- "I'm having negative thoughts, what should I do?"

## 🔍 **Possible Issues**

### **Issue 1: Model Not Following Schema**
**Symptom:** AI responds normally but no `nextAction`/`exerciseData`
**Cause:** Gemini Flash 1.5 may not be following the JSON schema properly

### **Issue 2: Edge Function Schema Issue**
**Symptom:** Consistent undefined values
**Cause:** Edge Function not parsing the new fields correctly

### **Issue 3: AI Reluctance**
**Symptom:** AI gives advice but doesn't suggest exercises
**Cause:** Model being too cautious about suggesting specific exercises

## 📊 **What to Report**

Please tell me:
1. **Does blue test button trigger any exercise suggestions?**
2. **What do the console logs show for nextAction/exerciseData?**
3. **Does AI respond normally to the stress message?**
4. **Any errors in console?**

If the blue test button doesn't work, we'll need to either:
- Switch to a different AI model
- Modify the prompt strategy
- Add fallback detection logic

The key is seeing if the AI returns the exercise fields at all!
