# Design Principles

## Core Philosophy
**"Calm Confidence Through Simplicity"**

The design creates a safe, trustworthy space that feels like a gentle companion rather than a clinical tool. Every element should contribute to a sense of peace, progress, and personal growth.

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- **Teal/Turquoise** (#4A9B8E to #6BB3A5): Primary brand color used for headers, buttons, and accents
- **Soft Mint** (#E8F4F1): Light teal backgrounds for cards and sections
- **Ocean Gradient**: Subtle teal-to-mint gradients for depth

### Supporting Colors
- **Warm Neutrals**: 
  - Soft grays (#F5F5F5 to #FAFAFA) for backgrounds
  - Medium gray (#6B7280) for secondary text
  - Dark gray (#2D3436) for primary text

### Accent Colors
- **Coral/Salmon** (#FFB5A0): Used sparingly in illustrations for warmth
- **Sky Blue** (#87CEEB): Complementary color in gradients and illustrations
- **Soft Yellow** (#FFF4E6): Occasional warm highlights in imagery

### Emotional Indicators
- Mood tracking uses gentle variations of teal, from lighter (positive) to deeper (contemplative)

## Typography

### Font Families
- **Ubuntu**: Primary font for UI elements, headers, and body text
  - Light (300): Subtle labels and secondary information
  - Regular (400): Body text and descriptions
  - Medium (500): Buttons and emphasis
  - Bold (700): Headers and titles

- **Bubblegum Sans**: Playful accent font
  - Used sparingly for friendly messaging or onboarding
  - Creates approachable, non-intimidating tone

### Typography Scale
- **Headers**: 24-28px, Ubuntu Bold
- **Subheaders**: 18-20px, Ubuntu Medium
- **Body**: 14-16px, Ubuntu Regular
- **Small Text**: 12-13px, Ubuntu Light
- **Button Text**: 14-16px, Ubuntu Medium, uppercase or sentence case

## Visual Language

### Imagery
- Abstract, calming nature scenes
- Soft gradients with organic shapes
- Watercolor-like textures
- Sunrise/sunset motifs suggesting hope and renewal
- Minimalist landscapes with soothing color transitions

### Shape Language
- **Rounded Corners**: Everything is soft (8-16px radius)
- **Organic Forms**: Flowing lines in graphics and backgrounds
- **No Sharp Edges**: Creating psychological safety through form
Visual Style Pattern:
"Organic Watercolor Minimalism in Monochromatic Teal"
Key Style Elements:

Color Palette: Gradient teal spectrum ranging from pale aqua to deep ocean blue-green
Technique: Soft watercolor with visible texture, bleeding edges, and organic flow
Composition: Isolated elements on white/neutral backgrounds with generous negative space
Forms: Nature-inspired silhouettes (profile, leaves, feather, tree) rendered as simple, recognizable shapes

Texture & Treatment:

Mottled, granulated watercolor texture with natural pooling and variation
Soft, diffused edges that suggest gentle dissolution into the background
Subtle paint splatters and dots that add spontaneity and movement
Translucent layering creating depth within the monochrome palette

Emotional Qualities & Feelings:

Serenity: The cool teal tones evoke calmness, like looking at shallow tropical water
Contemplation: The minimalist approach and negative space invite quiet reflection
Natural Harmony: Organic shapes suggest growth, life, and connection to nature
Gentle Strength: Soft execution with confident, singular forms
Meditative Simplicity: Uncomplicated designs that feel cleansing and peaceful

Style Description for Generation:
"Create minimalist watercolor illustrations using only teal/turquoise tones ranging from light aqua to deep teal. Feature single, nature-inspired silhouettes (botanical elements, organic shapes, or simple profiles) with soft, bleeding watercolor edges. Include visible texture with paint pooling, granulation, and occasional small splatters. Place elements on clean white backgrounds with ample negative space. The overall feeling should be serene, contemplative, and naturally elegant - like meditation through color and form."
This style would work beautifully for wellness brands, spa aesthetics, mindfulness apps, or any design requiring a sense of calm sophistication.
