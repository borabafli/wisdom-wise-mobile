### **3. AI Guidance Logic**

- Needs definition of:
    - **Session entry:** ask if user has something specific vs. wants guidance.
        
        **Session start choice:**
        
        - Ask: ‚ÄúDo you have something on your mind, or would you like me to guide you?‚Äù
    - **Exercise suggestion logic:** based on recent insights, user input, or personalization rules.
    - **Journey feel:** phrasing that makes the user feel guided (‚ÄúWe‚Äôre building step by step‚Ä¶‚Äù).
- Must decide **when AI probes deeper vs. when it moves forward.**
- Must clarify how **context is always explained** (why exercise matters, how many steps, benefits).

### **5. Tone of Voice**

- Needs to be fully defined as guidelines:
    - Persona (Turtle therapist: wise, calm, slightly playful).
    - Guardrails (what to avoid, how to phrase things).
    - Consistency (intro, exercise steps, reflections, nudges).
- Still open: what balance of *therapist / coach / friend* tone to take.

---

### **6. Guided Session Structure**

- Start: option between *free topic* vs. *guided session*.
- Middle: AI suggests exercise(s) or follows user topic.
- Transition: must not feel like a hard UI switch, but still give **context** (‚ÄúThis is a 3-step exercise, here‚Äôs why it helps‚Äù).
- End: capture reflection, save to Insights, close with motivation.
- Still to decide:
    - How much UI change we want when starting an exercise.
    - How much context is given upfront.
