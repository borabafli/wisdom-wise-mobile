# Exercise Card Fix - Implementation Summary

## üö® Issue Identified and Fixed

The exercise card wasn't showing because the **Edge Function** wasn't configured to handle exercise suggestion fields.

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **Edge Function Schema Updated** (`supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts`)

Added new fields to the JSON schema:
```typescript
// Added to response schema:
nextAction: {
  type: "string",
  description: "Optional: Set to 'showExerciseCard' when therapeutically suggesting an exercise to the user"
},
exerciseData: {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    type: { type: "string", description: "The exercise type (e.g., 'automatic-thoughts', 'breathing', 'mindfulness')" },
    name: { type: "string", description: "The display name of the exercise" }
  },
  required: ["type", "name"],
  description: "Exercise details when nextAction is 'showExerciseCard'"
}
```

### 2. **Response Parsing Enhanced**

Updated the Edge Function to:
- Parse `nextAction`, `exerciseData`, and `nextStep` from AI responses
- Include these fields in the final API response
- Log exercise suggestion attempts for debugging

### 3. **Client-Side Integration**

The client code was already properly configured to:
- Detect `response.nextAction === 'showExerciseCard'`
- Fetch full exercise data from `exerciseLibraryData[response.exerciseData.type]`
- Display the complete exercise card
- Handle smooth transitions

## üîß How to Deploy and Test

### Deploy the Edge Function:
```bash
# Set your Supabase access token
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Or use the --token flag
npx supabase functions deploy ai-chat --token your_token_here
```

### Test the Flow:
1. **Start a chat conversation**
2. **Ask for help with stress/anxiety** (triggers exercise suggestion)
3. **AI should respond** with exercise recommendation
4. **Exercise card should appear** with full details
5. **Click the card** ‚Üí smooth transition to exercise mode
6. **Previous messages preserved** + exercise flow begins

## üéØ Expected AI Response Format

The AI will now respond with:
```json
{
  "message": "It sounds like you're dealing with some difficult thoughts. Would you like to try an exercise that can help you recognize and reframe these patterns?",
  "suggestions": ["Yes, let's try it", "What kind of exercise?", "I'm not sure"],
  "nextAction": "showExerciseCard",
  "exerciseData": {
    "type": "automatic-thoughts", 
    "name": "Recognizing Automatic Thoughts"
  }
}
```

## üêõ Debugging

If the exercise card still doesn't show:

1. **Check console logs** for AI response parsing
2. **Look for** `nextAction: 'showExerciseCard'` in responses  
3. **Verify** `exerciseData.type` matches library keys
4. **Check** Edge Function deployment status

## üìã Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts` - Enhanced schema and parsing
- ‚úÖ `src/hooks/chat/useChatSession.ts` - Exercise transition logic  
- ‚úÖ `src/screens/ChatInterface.tsx` - Card handling
- ‚úÖ `src/services/contextService.ts` - AI prompts
- ‚úÖ `src/types/api.ts` - Response interfaces

The fix addresses the root cause: **the Edge Function wasn't configured to handle exercise suggestions**. Now it properly parses and returns the exercise fields needed to display the card.
