3. Offers gentle insights about growth opportunities
4. Provides warm, encouraging support

Story Context:
- Timeline: ${storyData.timeline}
- Main Story: ${storyData.mainStory}
- Themes explored: ${storyData.themes.join(', ')}
${storyData.deepeningAnswers ? `- Additional reflections: ${storyData.deepeningAnswers.map(qa => `${qa.question}: ${qa.answer}`).join('; ')}` : ''}

Please provide a structured reflection with:
1. A compassionate opening message (2-3 sentences acknowledging their courage in sharing)
2. 2-3 specific strengths you notice in their story
3. 1-2 resilience patterns or coping strategies they've demonstrated
4. 1-2 gentle growth opportunities (framed positively)
